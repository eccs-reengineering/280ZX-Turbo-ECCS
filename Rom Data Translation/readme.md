This spreadsheet is to identify useful areas of data for programming, for tuning AFR targets and iginition timing.

The addresses in the file do not match the addressing in the microcode. 

I place the data at 0x6000-0x7FFF on the 27c256 replacement ROMs to use with an off the shelf 2364-type ROM adapter. 

Refer to the HybridZ thread for more information on live tuning and editing the maps.
