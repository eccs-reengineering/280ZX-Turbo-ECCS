# 280ZX-Turbo-ECCS
JECS / NISSAN ECCS Motorola 6800 microcode pulled from 1982/1983 Datsun 280ZX ECU

I started out trying to just tune the maps, I succeded.
Now I've gotten interested in learning about fuel injection, microcontrollers and assembly language, so decided this is a good place to start as I'm already familiar with the hardware.
